## BASIC TERMINOLOGIES OF COMPUTER NETWORKS
- **Network** : a group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share data with each other
- **Node**: any device that can send, receive, and forward data in a network
- **Networking Devices** : device that manage and support networking function. This include routers, switches, hubs and access points.
- Firewall: a security tool that monitor traffics
## Type of Computer Network Architecture
- Client-Server Architecture: the server node can manage the Client Node Behaviour.
- Peer-to-Peer Architecture: each device is free for working as either client or server
## Network Devices
1. ROUTER
- Connects multiple networks
- Directs data packets to their correct destination
2. Switch
- Connects devices within a network
- Forwards data only to the specific device it is meant for
3. Hub
- connect devices in a local network
- send data to all devices
4. Bridge
- Connects and filter traffics between two networks or segments
5. Gateway
- Connect two diff type of networks
- Translates data between diff protocols

6. Access Point (AP)
- Provide wireless connectivity
- Extends a wired network into a WiFi  network

7. Modem
- Converts digital data from a computer into signal for phone/cable lines and vice versa
