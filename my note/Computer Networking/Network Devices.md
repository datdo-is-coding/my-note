### OVERVIEW
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed as a way to help disparate computing system communicate with each other.
- Most devices do function at more than one level of the OSI reference. In order to determine where they fit into the model -> determine the highest level which they operate.

### Layer 1 devices
- **Analog modem**: modems were developed to transform analog to digital interchangeably.
- A **hub** (repeater) does not care the where the signal comes from and where it is going. It takes the electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of the other ports.
### Layer 2 devices
- Switch (use ASIC application specific integrated circuit chip) is a network device that connects multiple devices within LAN (local network) and forwards data base on **MAC address**.(programmable)
- A **WAP (wireless access point)** is a device that let wireless devices connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi. (Only communicate on LAN)

### Layer 3 devices
**Multilayer switch (MLS)**
- an MLS provides some normal Layer 2, but it can provide layer 3 and higher.
- Most common is layer 3 switch: switching, handle routing-> allow to communicate to non-local network devices.
**Router**
- the most common for connecting different networks together ultilizing the OSI model's Layer 3 logical network information.
- uses software programming instead of ASIC.
- can communicate with both local and non-local network devices.
