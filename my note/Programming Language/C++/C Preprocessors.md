Preprocessors are program that process the source code before the actual compilation begins. They are not part of the compilation process but operate separately, allowing programmers to modify the code before compilation

- It is the first step that the C source code goes through when being converted into an executable file
- Main type of Preprocessor Directive are **Macros, File Inclusion, Conditional Compilation and Other Directives like #undef #pragma, etc**
- Mainly these directives are used to replace a given section of C code with another C code. E.g: if we write "#define PI 3.14", then PI is replaced with 3.14 by the preprocessor
